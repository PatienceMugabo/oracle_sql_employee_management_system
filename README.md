# school Management Database (Using Oracle as RDBMS)

This README provides an overview of a simple school database structure using four tables: Student, Teacher, Class, and Enrollment. The tables were crafted to maintain data integrity using primary and foreign key constraints. The Student table holds information about each student, the Teacher table stores teacher details, the Class table tracks various classes offered and their associated teachers, and the Enrollment table links students to classes, indicating which students are enrolled in which classes.
## Table Structures

### Student Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE Student (
    student_id NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL,
    date_of_birth DATE NOT NULL,
    gender VARCHAR2(10),
    address VARCHAR2(100),
    phone_number VARCHAR2(15),
    email VARCHAR2(50)
);
```

## Teacher Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE Teacher (
    teacher_id NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL,
    subject VARCHAR2(50),
    phone_number VARCHAR2(15),
    email VARCHAR2(50)
);


```

## Class Table

```sql

CREATE TABLE Class (
    class_id NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    class_name VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL,
    teacher_id NUMBER,
    schedule VARCHAR2(50),
    CONSTRAINT fk_teacher
        FOREIGN KEY (teacher_id) 
        REFERENCES Teacher(teacher_id)
);

```

## Enrollment Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE Enrollment (
    enrollment_id NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id NUMBER,
    class_id NUMBER,
    enrollment_date DATE NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT fk_student
        FOREIGN KEY (student_id) 
        REFERENCES Student(student_id),
    CONSTRAINT fk_class
        FOREIGN KEY (class_id) 
        REFERENCES Class(class_id)
);

```

# Inserting Records

To insert records into the tables, :

## Insert Countries

```sql
INSERT INTO Student (first_name, last_name, date_of_birth, gender, address, phone_number, email) 
VALUES ('Alice', 'Mukamana', TO_DATE('2005-03-15', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 'Female', 'Kigali', '0789123456', 'alice@example.com');

INSERT INTO Student (first_name, last_name, date_of_birth, gender, address, phone_number, email) 
VALUES ('John', 'Nkurunziza', TO_DATE('2004-07-21', 'YYYY-MM-DD'), 'Male', 'Huye', '0789765432', 'john@example.com');

INSERT INTO Student (first_name, last_name, date_of_birth, gender, address, phone_number, email)

```

## insert Departments

```sql

```
## Insert Roles

```sql
INSERT INTO Class (class_name, teacher_id, schedule) 
VALUES ('Math 101', 1, 'Mon-Wed-Fri 10:00 AM');

INSERT INTO Class (class_name, teacher_id, schedule) 
VALUES ('Physics 201', 2, 'Tue-Thu 09:00 AM');

INSERT INTO Class (class_name, teacher_id, schedule) 
VALUES ('Chemistry 301', 3, 'Mon-Wed-Fri 02:00 PM');

INSERT INTO Class (class_name, teacher_id, schedule) 
VALUES ('Biology 401', 4, 'Tue-Thu 11:00 AM');



```

## Insert Employees

```sql
INSERT INTO Enrollment (student_id, class_id, enrollment_date) 
VALUES (1, 1, TO_DATE('2024-01-10', 'YYYY-MM-DD'));

INSERT INTO Enrollment (student_id, class_id, enrollment_date) 
VALUES (2, 2, TO_DATE('2024-01-15', 'YYYY-MM-DD'));

INSERT INTO Enrollment (student_id, class_id, enrollment_date) 
VALUES (3, 3, TO_DATE('2024-01-20', 'YYYY-MM-DD'));

INSERT INTO Enrollment (student_id, class_id, enrollment_date) 
VALUES (4, 4, TO_DATE('2024-01-25', 'YYYY-MM-DD'));


```

## Conceptual, Logical and Physical Data Model

## Conclusion

The structured approach to creating, populating, and managing the database tables serves as a foundation for a school management system. By defining singular table names (Student, Teacher, Class, Enrollment), the data model becomes clear and organized. Each table's insertions were followed by a COMMIT to solidify changes, reflecting a best practice for maintaining consistent data states. This setup can be expanded with additional tables or columns as needed to accommodate further school data management requirements.
